    <h2>Hashdown vs. Google Forms</h2>
    <p>
      Hashdown is a simpler alternative to Google Forms. It's designed to be
      easy to use, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Google Forms, on
      the other hand, is a more powerful tool that offers more advanced features
      and capabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Hashdown vs. Traditional GUI-Based Form Builders</h2>
    <ol class="benefits-list">
      <li>
        <b>Speed and Simplicity:</b> With Hashdown, creating forms is as fast as
        typing. You don’t need to click through multiple menus or interfaces—just
        write in plain text using Markdown syntax. This is ideal for users who prefer
        a streamlined, no-frills approach to form creation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Markdown Familiarity:</b> For those already familiar with Markdown, Hashdown
        feels intuitive. Many developers, writers, and content creators use Markdown
        daily, making it second nature to create forms without having to learn a
        new visual editor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Focus on Functionality, Not Design:</b> Hashdown emphasizes function over
        form, so you can quickly generate forms without getting bogged down in design
        decisions. If your priority is collecting responses, rather than making the
        form look a certain way, Hashdown helps you cut to the chase.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>API Access and Automation:</b> Traditional GUI form builders often limit
        the level of automation and integration options. Hashdown provides an API,
        making it ideal for integrating form creation into your app or automating
        workflows. This is a major advantage for developers and businesses looking
        to streamline operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lightweight and Accessible:</b> Without the overhead of a full GUI, Hashdown
        is lightweight, making it faster to load and use. This is especially beneficial
        when working in environments with limited resources or when quick edits are
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Flexibility for Developers:</b> Developers can generate forms dynamically
        by writing plain text or through code, which allows for easier version control
        and scriptable workflows. Traditional GUI builders often have limitations
        when it comes to automation or integrating with development pipelines.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lower Learning Curve for Text-Based Creators:</b> For users who work in
        text-based environments (writers, researchers, etc.), Hashdown fits seamlessly
        into their workflow. There’s no need to adjust to a graphical interface—they
        can stick to their preferred way of working.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Clean and Consistent Output:</b> Because forms are built from a consistent,
        Markdown-based syntax, the output is always predictable and clean. You won’t
        need to worry about design inconsistencies that can sometimes occur in drag-and-drop
        builders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Shareable and Embeddable:</b> Hashdown instantly generates a shareable
        URL for your form, which can be shared anywhere or embedded on websites.
        This makes distribution simple, without requiring additional steps that GUI
        form builders might involve.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cost-Effective for Advanced Users:</b> Since Hashdown doesn’t require
        the development and maintenance of a heavy graphical interface, it may be
        more cost-effective for users who don’t need all the design capabilities
        of a traditional form builder.
      </li>
    </ol>
